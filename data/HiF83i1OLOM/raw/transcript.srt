1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
don't do invisible work.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,680
I would actually say that probably the lesson

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,440
to take away from this is that the most normie thing ever

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,360
is to like fight for your work

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,960
and to not do work that people don't see

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,080
and to get credit for your work.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,000
So we will go through

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,300
and you'll see a lot of the similar themes.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,160
So hi, I'm Chris.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,800
I don't know how to screen share apparently,

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,660
but I do work at a somewhat popular website.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,660
I also am a manager and I've been a manager for a long time

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,600
and I've also had managers.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,640
In fact, one of my managers is actually in this Slack.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,500
Grant is in here.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,240
So if you ever wanna know like just like

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,760
why my life is terrible,

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,360
just point to Grant and then just rag him right now.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,080
I can't actually see the Slack,

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,980
but definitely just point to Grant.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,960
So let's do a little visualization.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,600
This is a representation of all the work

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
that you as a diligent employee

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,100
of Acme software did in a month.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,180
Let's say this was like some big project

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,400
that the CEO wanted you to do, right?

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,780
And so it took five units of whatever.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,320
This is this recurring work that you do every week

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,760
where you standardize code

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,200
or debug something or something.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
And then here is one ad hoc thing off to the side

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
because someone from some department

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,400
you've never heard of before comes to you

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,000
and wants some kind of analysis.

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,880
The problem is that if you don't consciously spend the time

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,960
to track your work,

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,760
this is what you actually remember what you did

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
and like a week later.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,440
And everyone knows this feeling, right?

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,720
It is so hard to write about what you did the week before

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,980
if you wait until Monday.

42
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,260
And if we keep going with the same pattern,

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,500
this is what you remember a month later.

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,340
And if you go even farther, take one step away,

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,660
this is what your boss remembers,

46
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,220
all the things you did, right?

47
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,900
For a month later.

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,100
This is what your boss remembers a year later.

49
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,640
And everything else in there,

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,660
if it's not tracked in some way,

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,180
like if there's not a way to jog your memory that you did it

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,500
and very specifically to jog your boss's memory

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,700
that you did it, it is as if it is invisible work, right?

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,300
It means that you don't get credit for doing those things,

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,540
even though as we've established, if we go back,

56
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,500
like you did all this super cool stuff, right?

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,700
You worked on this big project,

58
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,140
you did this recurring debugging thing,

59
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,700
you talked to this like special person off to the side

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,180
and helped them out with the project.

61
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,260
And yet you don't get any credit for it from your boss

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,700
if no one remembers that it happens.

63
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,520
And the thing that I would like to point out

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,260
and the thing that I hope you take away

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,020
from this presentation is that it happens all the time,

66
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,340
all the time in tech, all over the place.

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,140
And the fundamental problem is that performance reviews

68
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,020
and promotion packets and whether or not you get a bonus

69
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,100
or whether or not you get targeted for a layoff

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,780
or whether or not you can do anything

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,220
is based on what people remember you did.

72
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,060
People as in your boss, your skip,

73
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,180
other peers and yourself, right?

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,940
If no one remembers that something happened,

75
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,540
it's as if you don't get credit for it.

76
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,420
And the problem is that without tools,

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,760
people really suck at remembering what people do.

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,380
The solution is both simple and frustratingly difficult.

79
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,620
It's to record your work and to tell people about it.

80
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,460
And this really parallels very closely

81
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,900
the stuff that Rose was talking about, right?

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,860
Figure out what matters, record whether you're doing it

83
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,120
and then tell people that you're doing it.

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,460
And that is like a very,

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,420
the reason I wanted to do this talk for this one

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,940
is it's a very, very like norm comfy idea.

87
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,060
It's just like record what you're doing

88
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,300
and tell people about it.

89
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,180
And the thing is that no one is gonna do this for you.

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,420
And some of you, some of you would be probably screaming

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,820
at your screen right now, because you're thinking,

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,220
well, I do all my work in, you know, GitHub, right?

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,020
Like, so therefore I could just look back in GitHub

94
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,300
and see every single thing I did.

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,180
The problem is that a lot of the work you end up doing

96
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,020
is actually valuable, but outside of GitHub.

97
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,480
So say if you work in some kind of proprietary system

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,020
off to the side, say you, you know, work in like,

99
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't know, like say Snowflakes IDE

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,120
or something like that, it might not appear in GitHub.

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,500
Say you end up like actually mentoring someone.

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,620
So like someone wants to be a data scientist

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,740
from the ads department,

104
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,580
you've spent a few lunches helping them out

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,860
or something like that.

106
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,140
You can actually end up in a situation

107
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,400
where you aren't getting credit for that work

108
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,200
because it doesn't appear in your regular tracking thing.

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,980
And the problem is that

110
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,260
because you're the primary beneficiary of this

111
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,300
and because GitHub is more about like tracking work

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,400
as if like with the goal of completing that work

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,340
for some kind of project,

114
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,180
not tracking your contribution as a whole,

115
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,240
a lot of this stuff can fall by the wayside.

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,660
And it means that the one of the best things

117
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,060
you can do for yourself,

118
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,180
really like just genuinely one of the best things

119
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,460
you can do for yourself is just record what you do

120
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,740
and tell people about it.

121
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,540
The other thing that comes up is that

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,180
some work is just more susceptible to being invisible.

123
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,260
Rose brought up Blue Work,

124
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,500
which is a very classic example of the type of work,

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,560
type of work that's very often done by women

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,740
in tech companies that is things that just don't appear

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,020
in many other places, right?

128
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,860
It would be things like mentorship or talking to customers

129
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,900
or expanding documentation or some kind of like

130
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
one-off project or things like communication.

131
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,700
That it's just, it's easy for that to fall by the wayside

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,900
because it's not naturally tracked in any kind of like

133
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,300
Asana or GitHub or something like that.

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,540
And so if you do some kind of like ad hoc mentorship

135
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,940
with someone and no one ever brings it up again,

136
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,740
again, it's as if it's a visible work.

137
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,900
It's as if you didn't do it.

138
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,260
You're not gonna get credit for it

139
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,620
for any kind of promotion.

140
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,500
And that's wrong.

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Like you should fight and get credit for it.

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,340
You already did the work.

143
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,740
You guys will get credit for it.

144
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,420
So what can we do?

145
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,220
It's a very complex two-step process.

146
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,980
I sort of joke here, but it's actually like,

147
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,060
it's actually really difficult to do.

148
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,140
And I'll talk to like, you know,

149
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,860
what some of the ways to get around it is.

150
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,260
One, build a really lightweight system

151
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,940
for tracking your own work and your own lightweight system.

152
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,020
Don't like rely on like the company system

153
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,860
for tracking your work, like build your own

154
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,500
that is hosted locally somewhere that you can control.

155
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
And then two, tell people about your work.

156
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,380
And there's various ways that you can end up doing that.

157
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,740
There are lots of ways to end up recording work.

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,220
And I don't, I, in designing this talk,

159
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,860
I didn't want to focus too much on like specific ways,

160
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,260
like Rose brought up the way that she ends up using.

161
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,900
There's lots of different ways.

162
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,980
I'll talk about a few of them.

163
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,420
I'll talk about my own one,

164
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,060
but whatever works for you is fine, right?

165
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,900
The only real requirements to this thing

166
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,460
is that you like record what you do

167
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,580
and then be able to like use that

168
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,620
and it'll communicate back to people.

169
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,220
Brag docs, Julie Evans, I think she came up with it.

170
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,540
And I want to give her credit for it

171
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,500
because I think she invented it,

172
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,700
but I don't want to like, if there was,

173
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,220
if it actually came up from somewhere else,

174
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,300
I don't want to like jump on their credit.

175
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,860
But that was the first time I read about it

176
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,060
was Julie Evans' work works blog posts.

177
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,940
And the idea behind of a brag document

178
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,580
is actually super powerful.

179
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,060
So you create this document that inside that document,

180
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,620
you write really polished notes about,

181
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,660
you know, like things that you've accomplished, right?

182
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,340
And so like you, you know, accomplish some projects,

183
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,140
you mentor some people, whatever it is,

184
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,620
and you write those little nuggets,

185
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,500
like in the document itself.

186
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,260
And then you share those document,

187
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,420
that exact document with your boss

188
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,540
or with your skip or something like that.

189
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,140
And the thing that's very,

190
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,060
that is very appealing about that approach

191
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,620
is that the thing that you're recording your work in

192
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,100
is also the thing that you're actually ending up sharing.

193
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
So your communication pathway using the doc

194
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,820
is actually the exact same as the way

195
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,380
that you're recording it.

196
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,660
There's tons of resources out there on Brag Docs.

197
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,940
Julia has a template.

198
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,620
There's also, you can literally go to bragdocs.com,

199
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,180
I think, and there's actually like a template there.

200
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,100
Like there's tons of really cool things out there.

201
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,300
There's lots of Brag Doc templates on GitHub.

202
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,420
It's a great approach.

203
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,060
What I do, because I was never able

204
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,700
to actually successfully accomplish a true Brag Doc,

205
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,780
is I keep a private activity log.

206
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,940
So instead of having a document

207
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,180
where I would write what I accomplished

208
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,340
and, you know, like for some kind of project,

209
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,180
I was always like the idea of writing something

210
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,660
in a way that was polished enough to share it to my boss

211
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,020
always kind of made it that I ended up procrastinating

212
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,780
actually writing down that I did the thing

213
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,780
and then I would forget.

214
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,860
And so it was just like vicious cycle.

215
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,460
So instead I kind of split them up

216
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,740
where I have a private activity log

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,820
where I just write super messy notes on what I did.

218
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,700
That is sort of the like really, you know,

219
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,740
super messy one line kind of notes,

220
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,740
mostly just to jog my memory later on that I did something.

221
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,900
The example on the second half of the slide

222
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,460
is a real example of my activity log.

223
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,380
I've changed like some dates and blah, blah, blah.

224
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,980
But like, basically this is what it looks like.

225
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,380
It's just hundreds of lines like this.

226
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,100
And I'm adding lines, you know,

227
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,380
I'm adding like two or three lines like a day,

228
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,820
every single day, just dumping them in.

229
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,060
And I don't think all those lines would really like

230
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,180
reach the level of brackiness.

231
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,140
I don't know what to put.

232
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,220
Really like reach that level of, you know,

233
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,460
wanting to like show that to people.

234
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,020
But I'm just like dumping anything

235
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,060
that I think might be useful for the, you know,

236
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,700
for the future that I can use it.

237
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,060
Then the second part,

238
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,060
which is that there's lots of ways

239
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,980
to tell people about your work.

240
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,940
And I think the thing that was difficult for me

241
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,020
with the Brag Doc was that a lot of times,

242
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,900
like the way that organizations communicate

243
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
their performance and communicate like the work that you did

244
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,780
is often like weirdly formal.

245
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,180
So at the Wikimedia Foundation,

246
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,060
like in Grant's, Grant was my boss

247
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,260
at the Wikimedia Foundation.

248
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,220
We'd have like a separate thing,

249
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,180
like every quarter I would like paste what I did

250
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,340
into betterworks.com.

251
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,980
That was where I paste it.

252
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,260
And so like, it didn't really work

253
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,620
with the Brag Document format,

254
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,900
cause I would have to like take it out

255
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,460
and put it into this like separate third-party SaaS platform

256
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,060
to show my work.

257
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,740
And so, you know, to me, I think like, of course,

258
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,420
like using the internal places of reporting work,

259
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,540
like we used better works,

260
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,860
so I would put it into better works.

261
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,620
Written is way better than doing it verbally

262
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,380
because you remember things longer if it's written

263
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,980
and you can refer it back to them.

264
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
But I don't think you should like discount

265
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,020
the just informal, like bringing up

266
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,300
that you did something, right?

267
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,780
Like if you're having like a casual one-on-one

268
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,100
with your manager, glance through your doc

269
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,420
and make sure you say some of the things

270
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,020
that you think might be interesting, right?

271
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,980
Like just like, it's, I wouldn't like formalize everything

272
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,140
to the point where like the only way

273
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,420
that you're talking about your work

274
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,780
is through like this one document.

275
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,900
I would just be like, I have tons of ammunition

276
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,180
in my activity log and I'm just like hammering them out

277
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,620
through every medium possible.

278
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm talking about it on Slack,

279
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,660
I'm writing a weekly update to the whole staff

280
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,260
where I'm putting things in there.

281
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm talking about it in weekly one-on-ones verbally,

282
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm putting it into like a one-on-one note doc

283
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,220
if I have like whatever I can, I'm like pushing it out there

284
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,940
that I'm doing this kind of stuff.

285
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,940
The one that's kind of like incredibly impressive

286
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,660
and I think I would like to do more of

287
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,380
is blog posts and newsletters.

288
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,340
So there was this person who worked at Slack

289
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,500
and I won't name her, but she was really accomplished

290
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,540
at Slack and an amazing person.

291
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,260
And one of the things that she talked about

292
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,060
sort of in like a private meeting

293
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,340
was that like by putting stuff out there

294
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,620
in blog posts and newsletters,

295
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,500
you know, like here's this cool project we did,

296
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,900
here's all the work I did on it

297
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,420
and that kind of stuff, like a project on your,

298
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,780
like on a blog post on your personal blog,

299
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,860
you are in a way communicating it

300
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,740
in a way that you can then refer to later.

301
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,980
And so like even things like writing stuff

302
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,540
for this audience is actually a way

303
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,300
for you to communicate out that you're doing stuff,

304
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,260
which is just super valuable.

305
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,740
And it, you know, we talk about things like Brad documents

306
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,500
or activity log in terms of like promotion

307
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,780
for your current job.

308
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,820
So think about it in terms of job security,

309
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,540
but there's a huge benefit to actually just telling

310
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
the world that you're doing stuff.

311
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,460
Like if you're doing some super cool, I don't know,

312
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,940
like some super cool new Kubernetes thing

313
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,020
or something like that, like, you know,

314
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,900
like record that stuff in your activity log,

315
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,580
write a blog post about it and put it out into the world.

316
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,100
And like, you get, you will get credit for that

317
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,620
in ways that are really interesting.

318
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,940
You'll get, you know, someone when you're applying for a job,

319
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,300
someone will look at your personal site,

320
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,900
see the kind of stuff that you're doing,

321
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,100
think it's super interesting,

322
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,620
and then you'll sort of advance the next round

323
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,700
or something like that.

324
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,060
And it's just, it's really useful,

325
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,180
but you're not gonna be able to do that

326
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
if you're not sort of recording for yourself

327
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,060
like what you do.

328
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,780
The other one is that you should definitely

329
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,660
keep personal access to the things.

330
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,620
Don't just rely on the internal customer company systems.

331
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,940
I say that because honestly, like no joke,

332
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,980
the best place to put like your activity log

333
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,380
or what you're doing, like the most easiest place,

334
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,300
and it's wonderful, is if your company uses Slack,

335
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,140
just use your own Slack channel,

336
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,220
like direct message yourself on Slack.

337
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,780
That's like, it's timestamped, it's awesome, it's amazing.

338
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,100
But if you lose access to Slack,

339
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,700
you're gonna lose access to all that information.

340
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,980
So like, I don't use that even though it's so nice

341
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,660
and easy and simple to use,

342
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,460
but you really do wanna make sure that like,

343
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,260
whatever happens, right, you can do it.

344
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,700
And I actually messaged in our Slack for this conference

345
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,260
that like the Brag Doc or Activity Log

346
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,380
or whatever you wanna do is a tool

347
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,340
for you to build your resume.

348
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,220
Like if you lose your job

349
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,540
and you need to like update your resume,

350
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,500
all of a sudden you have, you know,

351
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
this huge record of what you've done,

352
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
and you can sift through it

353
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
and find some really interesting stuff.

354
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,660
The goal for this whole thing is if someone asks your boss

355
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,140
or like someone asks a recruiter or something like,

356
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,300
what have you done?

357
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,020
They have that deep well of examples to choose from.

358
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,860
And actually, you know,

359
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,140
Rose brought up this like really great point

360
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,580
that I think people overlook,

361
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,300
that as a manager, I know that there are times

362
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,540
that I'm advocating for a staff member

363
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,100
or like one of my reports,

364
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,140
and then the report doesn't know that, right?

365
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,260
There's some like special project that's coming up

366
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,220
and I want them to be the one doing it.

367
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,060
And someone's like,

368
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,500
oh, I don't know if they're the right person.

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,460
And like, if I have that, you know,

370
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,340
like if I can dig through those notes

371
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,700
and those Brag Docs for them or whatever they have listed,

372
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,380
like I can bring up all these great examples.

373
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,900
If I remember all those great examples,

374
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
if I can look through their, you know,

375
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,860
like formal, like, you know, letters that they're writing,

376
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,260
like weekly updates or whatever that they're writing,

377
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,740
I can use that as ammo for like an argument.

378
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,220
And their actual report who wrote them,

379
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,540
like doesn't even know that I'm doing this, right?

380
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,620
But like, it's important, it's important.

381
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,860
And if you have a good manager,

382
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,900
that manager is advocating for you.

383
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,060
And it's great to give them that kind of ammunition

384
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
that they can use,

385
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,380
even though if you end up not seeing it in any, you know,

386
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
like you don't actually know

387
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,900
that they're doing it at the moment.

388
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,660
That is the end of my talk.

389
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,940
And here's my little,

390
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,660
I'm gonna add this to my own activity log,

391
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,260
gave a presentation at NormConf because, you know,

392
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,420
we should all track our work.

393
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,580
And I definitely think probably the most normy thing to do

394
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,860
is just to take credit for what we do,

395
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:34,860
because what we do is pretty freaking awesome.
