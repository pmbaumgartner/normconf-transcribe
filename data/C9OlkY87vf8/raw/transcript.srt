00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
Hey, everybody. Welcome to NormConf. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I am

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,060
going to start off. So it's very appropriate that James and Jesse were talking about Bards

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,720
because what I want to do is I actually want to tell you a machine learning fairy tale.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:27,600
Once upon a time in the kingdom of all users contained in a matrix of M by N in the real

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,560
number space, there lived a girl named Vectorella who was a machine learning engineer. And Vectorella

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,960
was pretty happy. She was doing her machine learning stuff. She worked for a company that

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,680
made Nutella, which is everybody knows is everybody's favorite spread for hypothesis

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,180
testing fans. And as a company that made Nutella, this company shipped it far and wide across

9
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,620
all places, both in the user matrix space and in the real world across hundreds and

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,680
hundreds of countries. Now, as such, they had a lot of business transactions and a lot

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,140
of data to deal with. So Vectorella had to handle a bunch of different stuff as a machine

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,200
learning engineer. She had to handle API errors, time zone issues, import errors, K8s. And

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,040
she was generally pretty okay with this, but she wanted a lot more. And what Vectorella

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,720
saw whenever she went to her work slack was past the air flow alerts, past the memes,

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,040
past the spark issues, there was a private channel that she could see that was called

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,080
staff Emily's. And all Vectorella wanted to do was to get into that staff Emily channel

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,160
with all of her heart. She was doing her day to day stuff, but she thought they were doing

18
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:58,560
more in there. She thought they might have been doing stable diffusion or chat GPT. And

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,360
all she wanted to do was do that cool stuff instead of the stuff that she did on a day

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,420
to day basis. One day a miracle happened. Her very cool boss sent her a text message

21
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,120
and said, hey, I think you've been doing a lot of this great work and it's time for you

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,480
to join this channel. And Vectorella said, this is amazing. I would love to join this

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,520
channel. But then a misfortune befell Vectorella. She went through a rework. And so what happened

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,560
was the cool boss she used to have was replaced by an evil boss and two step PMs. So now not

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,440
only did she have different work, but she had three people managing her work. And so

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,200
she was further away from that staff Emily channel than she ever thought possible. And

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,080
she said, can we, can I please go to this channel to her new evil step PMs and step

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,320
manager? And they said, no, we have a lot of work for you to do. You have to do these

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:04,040
three tasks. If you do these three tasks, maybe we will let you in the channel. Maybe

30
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,360
we'll have to see how well you do them. And so Vectorella thought, okay, I guess I've

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
already been doing a lot of this work, but I really want to see what they're discussing

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:26,240
in there. So she put on her hat and got to work. The first task that they gave her was

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,840
to count sales. So Noltella comes in all sorts of varieties, large jars, medium jars, small

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,480
jars. And in order to increase revenue, they also branched out into gelato and biscuits.

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,400
Vectorella's job was to count all of these. Don't forget it shipped both in the multidimensional

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,560
vector space and in the real world. So there were sales across many, many countries. So

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,680
she had sales for the U S Morocco and Japan and lots of other places. So she said, okay,

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,080
I guess I'll do this. So she took all the orders that were placed in the United States.

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,740
So there were biscuits, medium, small, large jars, et cetera. She had an enormous list.

40
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,520
And she took that from the transaction logs and put that into a list. Then she said, okay,

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,440
I guess I'll count these. So for every item in the orders, she added it to a default dict

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,640
and then she incremented the counter for everyone in the U S until she had all her items added

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,320
up all together. She wasn't done though yet, because there are a lot of other countries

44
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,440
that had these sales. So she also had to do the same thing for Japan, Morocco, China,

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,360
France, Italy, and others. At this point in Vectorella was getting really bored, but she

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,640
really wanted to be in that channel. So then she said, okay, well now I guess I have to

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,120
add all of these countries together. So then she incremented a counter. She took all her

48
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,400
global orders and she added an incremented those orders as well, so that she had a global

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:15,880
count of everything all together. And she said, okay, I guess this is it. I did this.

50
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,860
This is so boring. And then she went to her evil step boss and step PMs and said, is this

51
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,960
getting me closer to getting into that Slack channel? And they said, sure, but we have

52
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,320
a second task for you. Now you have to turn words and millions of recipes into numbers.

53
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,720
And Vectorella said, why, why do I have to do this? This is going to be so boring. And

54
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,880
they said, just do it. Don't ask questions. So she said, okay. And she went to see that

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,280
the recipes that Noltella had illegally scraped from the internet to do work with. She wasn't

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,960
sure about that part, but she did look at these recipes and they had things like a list

57
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,880
of ingredients, a list of steps, a list of things that went together to make things out

58
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,320
of Noltella. So for example, this is a Noltella cake and there were millions of these. And

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,480
she said, okay, well, how am I going to turn these into numbers? So what she did was first

60
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:25,520
she turned it into code and she created a big long string for each recipe. Then she

61
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,520
said, okay, what am I going to do next? I guess I have to clean this data so I can somehow

62
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,360
process these strings. And so Vectorella did what she did best, which was clean a lot of

63
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,520
data. So she had to lowercase all the stuff. She had to take out the contractions. She

64
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,840
had to remove all the symbols, strip all the spaces. This is so boring. I bet they're doing

65
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,640
stable diffusion in there, she thought as she was writing all this cleaning data.

66
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Then she had her cleaned words and then she thought, okay, what am I going to do next?

67
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,680
Then she ended up mapping each word in the clean list to an integer, to a sequential

68
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,080
integer. She said, okay, this is kind of something. But this is not really what they were asking

69
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,720
for, I think. And so then what she did next was to actually encode the words. And so what

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,600
she did was she created, she took the dictionary and for each word in the dictionary, she assigned

71
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,280
it to a vector of zeros and then everywhere in the vector where the word actually was,

72
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,560
she replaced it with a one. And then what she ended up having was a set of one hot encodings.

73
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,720
And she said, okay, I guess this is something. What is this? Why am I doing this? I could

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,120
be posting memes in that channel right now. People would be liking it and appreciating

75
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,560
it instead of making dictionaries. Vectorella was tired and angry. So she went to her step

76
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:12,080
PMs and her step manager and said, look, I've created this. I've processed them. I've mapped

77
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,120
my vocab and I've encoded them so that I actually have vectors for each word. Is this something?

78
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,480
Can I go now? And they said, no. You have one more task. Since you did these other two

79
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,680
tasks and they were reasonably okay, we'll see if we let you in the channel after that.

80
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,120
Now you have to schedule these to run every day on a daily basis because we sell Nutella

81
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:44,200
every day and we also need to process it every day. And Vectorella said, oh, I just want

82
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,840
to be in that room. So what she did was she rolled up her sleeves again and she created

83
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,480
a crontab script that ran every day and that did a couple of things. First, it took all

84
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,520
the code that she had run on her local machine and it's linked to a remote Linux server because

85
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,840
Nutella only has one remote Linux server. It's a very norm core company. And then what

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,640
that script does is at the same time every day, it runs that sales script and that number

87
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:22,560
script. And she said, okay, I'm done. I cleaned everything. And she said, please, please,

88
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,320
can I be in that channel? And they said, okay, fine. You win. So the fairy SRE came along

89
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:39,280
and gave her all the correct admin access and unlocked the staff MLE channel. And that's

90
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:50,600
when Vectorella became staff MLE Vectorella. Vectors. But when she got to the channel,

91
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:59,280
she noticed something weird. She noticed that these staff MLEs were asking interesting questions.

92
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,440
So the first one asked, hey, how do I run a distributed Spark job on a million parquet

93
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,320
files in an S3 bucket to get the total counts of receipts for my sales forecast model? And

94
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:21,920
Vectorella thought, hmm, curious. She thought, what do I know about Spark? What is Spark?

95
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,680
So Spark is a way to do computation through data parallelism and fault tolerance across

96
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,960
multiple commodity machines. What does that mean in English? It means that you can take

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,480
a program that computes the frequencies or sums of all words or items in your sales catalog

98
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,640
occurring in a set of text files and prints or outputs the most common ones. So what Vectorella

99
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:54,120
realized was that the Spark diagram on the left was actually what she had been doing

100
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,720
in adding sales per country and then aggregating them across the world this entire time. Vectorella

101
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:10,880
was shocked and scandalized, but there was more in store for Vectorella. Second, in that

102
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,160
super secret staff MLE Slack channel, she did not see people multiplying matrices or

103
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,840
working on stable diffusion. What she did see, well, she kind of did, but not really.

104
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,520
Not for the sake of the narrative. What she did see was the super staff MLE number two

105
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,700
that said, I'm trying to create a set of embeddings projected into a lower dimension space to

106
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,520
predict which ingredients I can cluster with Nutella for optimal combinations to show my

107
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,840
customers. What does this mean? It means you have millions of recipes and you have one

108
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,880
Nutella and you want people to select ingredients that they can cluster together to suggest

109
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,400
what they can make with Nutella. So for example, on the right hand side, if you have lemon,

110
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,960
peppermint and cream and they commonly cluster together, you can suggest that they make Nutella

111
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,680
cookies. If you have vanilla, butter and chocolate, you can suggest that they make a Nutella cake,

112
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,040
which requires buying four to five jars of Nutella. Buy Nutella, stock goes up. If you

113
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,240
have for some reason, banana and pizza dough and crepe, I'm sorry about this one. You can

114
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,600
make something in the category of sandwiches potentially, or flatbreads or something similar

115
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,760
that you can sell Nutella to. But for that, you need to generate embeddings out of text

116
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,120
and vector. I thought, well, what is an embedding? Embeddings are just a way to compress highly

117
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,680
dimensional data, such as text or images and no smaller dimensional space by assigning

118
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,040
each data point to a vector and comparing similarity of those vectors to each other.

119
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,200
So she thought, okay, well, what is this? This sounds familiar to what was she doing?

120
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,680
She was just creating vectors too. And in fact, if you go to the wonderful PyTorch documentation,

121
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,440
it'll tell you that the one hot vectors that we created, which are sparse because they

122
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
only have data points at certain points, are actually a special case of dense word embeddings,

123
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,280
which we use for deep learning and stable diffusion.

124
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,160
Finally, a third super staff machine learning engineer was asking a different question.

125
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Vectorola was puzzled. She thought this channel was going to be super high level discussions,

126
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,520
theory, et cetera. But what they asked is, can someone validate my Airflow job to update

127
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:42,480
my machine learning retraining pipeline? And Vectorola thought, what is Airflow?

128
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,420
She remembered that Airflow is a programmatic way to create, monitor, and deploy batch workflows

129
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,040
on a scheduled basis. She thought, what does this sound like? This sounds like something

130
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:05,120
that I've done before. It sounds like fancy crontab. So Airflow is basically fancy crontab.

131
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,720
It's a way to schedule a lot of different complicated tasks, like, for example, your

132
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,820
Python scripts or your model runs. So it turned out that Vectorola had been doing this also

133
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:23,020
kind of all along. What is the moral of the story? Basically,

134
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:30,380
in the data science, machine learning, and general data space, we are all Vectorola today.

135
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,200
Why? Because the advertised map for what we do at work is not the true territory. The

136
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,760
interviews that we go through, the medium articles that we read, the hacker news articles

137
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,800
that we read, all of this work, not all of it is encompassed by what we do on a day to

138
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,440
day basis, which is crontab, and creating dictionaries and adding things to lists. This

139
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:00,460
is the heart of the true work of machine learning. Second, what Vectorola realized is that building

140
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,640
machine learning systems is just building software. And building software is fragile.

141
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,200
It has lots of different components. It has lots of things that break. It's not glamorous.

142
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,880
It's not sexy. It's real true work that you need to do to get your stuff to work. And

143
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,360
that's what she had been doing when she started working on this.

144
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,480
Third, even advanced work deals with normal problems. So this is actually a screenshot

145
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,400
for when I tried to register for chat GPT on the first day it came out. And potentially

146
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,040
they were having problems serving web requests, which has nothing to do with the really complicated

147
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,800
and impressive model that was happening in the back end, which goes to my last point,

148
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,920
which is that data work is also engineering work, and we deal with a lot of the complexities

149
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,520
and fiddling with all the pieces that that entails.

150
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,920
And finally, something that Vectorola realized was that the solid fundamentals that she had

151
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,080
been working all along that seemed very boring to her and not related to what she had read

152
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,600
about in the media were actually the fundamentals. And if she learned those very well, then she

153
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,400
could do and be present for the advanced work as well. And I think that's something that

154
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,080
we can all take to heart. So what Vectorola realized is that she now lived enlightened

155
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:35,600
ever after, still also in the staff MLE room because the fairy Asari had forgotten to rotate

156
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,640
her credentials. And so something we can all take away is ad astra per aspera. This is

157
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,240
kind of like my personal motto. It means the stars through difficulty. We're all going

158
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,520
to deal with this stuff. We're all going to have this happening. And it's up to us to

159
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,640
embrace it. So thank you. I want to say a couple of thank yous before I go. That was

160
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,360
my talk. First of all, enormous thank you to all the Norm Conrad organizers, Gania,

161
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,760
Ben, Jeremy, and Roy. The amount of late nights, the amount of time spent, the love and effort

162
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,480
put into this conference is amazing. I hope everyone sees it and enjoys it. We had so

163
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,080
much fun planning it, and we hope you all love it too. Thank you to the emcees and moderators.

164
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,800
Again, these people are, to my knowledge, not being paid for any of this. Everybody

165
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,840
is doing it for fun and for love. And I'm excited to share this with you. Thank you

166
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,240
to the speakers who I also voluntold to speak. I'm excited to hear what you're going to talk

167
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,520
about. Thank you to our sponsors. If you are in Slack, you can come visit their booths.

168
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,520
And they're all on our website. Thank you to our lightning speakers who led the way

169
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,160
for the pregame to the conference and who had some amazing talks. Thank you to Numfocus,

170
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,680
who make the tools that we use and who we're donating the optional donations of the conference

171
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,680
to. And finally, thank you to you. This event would be nothing without the spirit of the

172
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,960
data community, with everyone that works on this stuff, that contributes to it, and that

173
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,960
builds on it every day. Welcome to NormCon!
