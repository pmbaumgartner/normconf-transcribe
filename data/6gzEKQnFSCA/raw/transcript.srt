00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good evening, everyone. My name is Rose Wigley. I'm a senior staff software engineer at Shopify.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,940
Our team likes for me to mention that we are hiring for limited roles. So please check

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:19,840
out our job page if you're interested. Today, I'm going to start with a story.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,440
Once upon a time, in the land before there was a cloud.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,860
Shortly after Y2K failed to lead to the end of the world. But right as it was starting

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,260
to feel like the end of the world in tech. The first time, that is.

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,720
There was a young software engineer working at a startup who wanted a raise. Her name

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,160
was Rose. Yes, that is my name. But in this case, Rose

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,720
also stands for the gigantic pair of rose colored glasses I viewed the world through.

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,320
For example, I was so naive, I believed the startup when they told me that all those options

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,900
I should buy outright were going to make me rich.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,440
The type of rich where 21 years in the future, I would be relaxing in my cabin on 500 acres

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,160
instead of madly writing conference slides a week before my talk was due.

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,680
Luckily, you'll notice my husband has a very clear pair of glasses. Well, except about

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,080
stock options. We both made that mistake in the beginning.

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,560
One day after work, I was venting at how frustrated I was. I had been trying to get my raise for

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,480
some time and still hadn't gotten one. And that's when he asked what seemed like the

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:57,720
absolutely most ridiculous question ever. Have you asked for a raise?

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,400
At which point, I looked slightly horrified and said, of course not. I've been working

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,200
really hard and putting in lots of extra hours. Aren't they just supposed to give me one because

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,080
I deserve it? This sums up the look on his face when I said

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,400
that. After recovering, he looked at me and said, okay, please sit down. We need to have

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,120
a talk. And that was the day I learned what now seems

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,600
obvious. It doesn't matter how much you deserve something. If you don't ask for it, you aren't

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,520
going to get it. So why data-driven promotions? Because even

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:55,520
asking isn't enough. Wikipedia says the adjective data-driven means

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,880
that progress in an activity is compelled by data rather than by intuition or by personal

28
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,120
experience. How many of us have either had or have heard

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,720
of someone asking for a promotion just to be told? I feel you aren't at that level yet.

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,440
But I can't tell you why. I like to imagine this in my best Lumberg voice, but I can't

31
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,640
do an imitation of it. Something as important as promotions and raises

32
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,840
should not be left up to someone else's intuition, especially since that's a great way to introduce,

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,200
you know, unconscious or even conscious bias into the process.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,760
As an example, a study by MIT Sloan associate professor Daniel Lee found that on average,

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,180
women receive higher performance ratings than male employees, but receive 8.3% lower ratings

36
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,920
for potential. Potential being the exact sort of thing a manager is going to think about

37
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,240
when deciding on a promotion. If we make our promotions dependent on other

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:13,840
people's feelings, they are no longer dependent on what we have done and what we can do.

39
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,400
But just like we can't rely on others to automatically give us the promotions we deserve, we also

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,780
can't rely on others to gather the data that shows we deserve them.

41
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,600
Even if you have the absolute best manager in tech, they will not be able to do that.

42
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,760
Managers are busy. And good managers are not looking over your shoulder every single second.

43
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,640
There is only one single person who can talk about everything you have done. And that is

44
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,260
you. So how do you do that?

45
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:58,080
Data-driven promotions in three easy steps. Okay. Well, except I'm introverted with a

46
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,360
strong case of ADHD diagnosed late in life. Maybe not easy.

47
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,200
And if you noticed on my first slide, I have some teenagers. And if you're thinking about

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,440
a promotion, I'm guessing your workday is very full.

49
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,700
And there's those three really important things you just have to go to first.

50
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,600
So how about this? Data-driven promotions in three rather difficult

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,160
to get around to but very important steps. To remember these steps, I have a nice acronym.

52
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,520
What is the first thing you are going to think after working super hard, super long, and

53
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,240
being told by your manager they don't feel like you are ready?

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:06:01,920
WTF. Or more precisely, first, W, what matters? T, track progress. And F, frame your review.

55
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,000
First, W, what matters? Before we can talk about what matters, we

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,380
first have to talk about what does not matter. If you've never seen Tanya Riley's excellent

57
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,280
talk on Glue Work, I highly recommend watching it.

58
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,500
Glue Work can be summed up as work that keeps teams running but doesn't directly contribute

59
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,840
to the product. Things like documentation, unblocking others, tooling, taking notes,

60
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,560
planning team activities. Glue Work is often picked up by women and is often one of the

61
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:47,260
reasons women will be passed over for a promotion as excellent but not technical enough.

62
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,000
You want to make sure you are mostly doing promotable work and sharing the glue work

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,320
across the team. But what is promotable work? That totally

64
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,280
depends on your current role and your next role.

65
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,020
To define out exactly what that is, I recommend making yourself a responsibility matrix. Grab

66
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,940
your favorite spreadsheet software and set it up with three columns.

67
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,360
Column one is going to be for the subheaders or for the headers and subheaders for the

68
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,120
general areas of responsibility your organization uses to judge your performance.

69
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,040
These categories should cover everything you would be expected to be due both technically,

70
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,500
as a leader, as a teammate. If it's part of what somebody in your job should do, it should

71
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,680
be covered by one of these. Column two is going to be your put your current

72
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,320
role on top. And then underneath for each of those headers and subheaders, list out

73
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,280
the behaviors that are expected under that topic for your current role.

74
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Then for column three, you're going to put in the role you want to be promoted to. And

75
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,360
repeat column two except for that role instead. You want to cover both of these because at

76
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,080
many companies, there's a little unwritten or unspoken, sometimes spoken, rule of tech

77
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,520
that in order to be promoted, you have to show you are already acting at the next level

78
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,000
or at least doing a lot of the tasks at that level.

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,520
You need to know what that is so you can start targeting your tasks appropriately.

80
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,960
If you're lucky, the place where you work has a documented job level expect has already

81
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,760
documented job level expectations in detail. That will make this task easy. I was able

82
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,280
to make my personal matrix by literally copying lines out of a company-wide document that

83
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,040
says exactly what is expected at each category for each level.

84
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,240
But what if your company has no documented job level expectations?

85
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, unless you work at a very tiny startup, we have an industry word for that. We call

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,920
it a red flag. If a company can't tell you what you should be doing, how can they possibly

87
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,520
judge that you are doing it? More practically speaking, that means you have a lot more work

88
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,160
ahead of you. You still need that responsibility matrix. In fact, it's even more important

89
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,960
than ever. Before you can work on being promoted, you first have to agree with your manager

90
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:49,640
on what that even means. But this means you're going to have to at least start it yourself.

91
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,040
You're going to make a responsibility matrix just like before, but this time you're going

92
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,360
to have to do a lot of the research. Get online, talk to friends in the industry, look for

93
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,920
what general industry standards are for each role, both what you want to be and the one

94
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,400
you're aiming for. Then you need to go to your boss and have a really good conversation

95
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,880
with them. Show them the information that you've gathered. Let them know that you want

96
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,320
to work towards this promotion. And most importantly, ask them for their advice on how to build

97
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,160
out what's missing. Even if you kick off this project, you want to get your boss's buy-in

98
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,400
on it and contributions as early as possible. Because in the end, they're the one who's

99
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,920
going to have to agree that this is what these definitions are. At the end, you should both

100
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,360
have an understanding of what each role looks like.

101
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,680
So now we have a definition of what you should be doing. So we go to the next step, T, track

102
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,040
your progress. The best thing you can do to track your progress is keep an ongoing brag

103
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,520
document. This is where you keep track of your accomplishments as you make them. Julia

104
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,620
Evans has a great blog post on brag documents. I highly recommend reading it. I wish my younger

105
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,320
self could have read this post years ago. It starts with, there is this idea that if

106
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,680
you do great work at your job, people will or should automatically recognize that work

107
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:44,080
and reward you for it with promotions, increased pay. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? However,

108
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,880
I recommend one variation on the brag document. Remember this responsibility matrix we made

109
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:59,920
in step W? Organize your brag document by each subcategory in your responsibility matrix.

110
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,760
Include the descriptions for your current and next role under each header as an easy

111
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,760
reminder to yourself. Then list out what you have done in each category with the date that

112
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,920
you did it or the date range. Just to remind yourself, drop a star by anything you think

113
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:25,760
counts as next level work. Side note, if you had to make a responsibility matrix from scratch

114
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,160
for step one, make sure that lands on your brag document under something like, help define

115
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,280
job level expectations for roles at the company. That sounds a lot like a task I would expect

116
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,520
out of a manager, for example. Occasionally, skim over your brag document. It should become

117
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,280
obvious where you are clearly meeting your level, the next level, or where you need to

118
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,920
spend some extra time and focus. You want your brag document to be your map of where

119
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:06,940
you are and where you need to go. You can use this map in two ways. First, it can point

120
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,640
you to where you need to focus more time. If there is a category or two where you currently

121
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,560
do nothing or are even weak for in your current role, then you need to find some work in that

122
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,280
area. However, we do not need to be experts at everything. The brag document can show

123
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,800
you where your strengths and where your weaknesses lie. For your weaknesses, you can do just

124
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,080
enough to assure people you have the ability to do the work. Then, focus on your strengths.

125
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,720
So you have a few things you do at a level that knocks it right out of the park. You

126
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,800
want one or two items that's going to make people go, wait, what do you mean they aren't

127
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:04,380
already at that level? Finally, F, frame your review. The funniest thing a manager ever

128
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:11,720
said to me during a review was, I was very entertained by your self-reflection. It was

129
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,260
also one of the more startling things a manager said to me because I wasn't sure what he meant

130
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:24,360
at first. What was so entertaining by my self-reflection? It turned out it's because I organized it

131
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,720
a lot like my brag document. When a review is about to start, when you are planning to

132
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,040
ask for a raise or a promotion, when you just need to check with your manager, take your

133
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:46,560
brag document and use it to show what you have done in each category. I will go through,

134
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,420
word it nicer, clean things up, collapse multiple things down into a category. I don't mark,

135
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,320
in this case, the things that are work at the next level. I assume, for starters, that

136
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,480
my manager knows what the next level is and will recognize that. However, I'm also always

137
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,140
prepared because I have the responsibility matrix. If it looks like my manager is missing

138
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:22,520
its next level, we can talk about why it counts at that level.

139
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:32,920
That's it. WTF. W, you want to know what matters. T, you want to track your progress. F, you

140
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,360
want to frame your review so that you're providing your manager with the information that shows

141
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,800
why are you ready for the next level. Before we end, I want to stop and talk about two

142
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:56,980
final things. First, I want us to pause because this advice makes some assumptions. First,

143
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,640
it assumes you are ready for a promotion. This isn't a check box activity where you

144
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,820
do one thing under each category and once you've checked off all the items, that means

145
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,180
you're ready for a promotion. Usually, you have to be working at this level long enough

146
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:26,580
to show that you can do this skill repeatedly for your company at the level that's expected.

147
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,360
Just because you put a single check mark in each thing, that does not mean when you go

148
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,040
to talk to your manager, they're going to be like, okay, we're all set. Now you're going

149
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:44,780
to get your promotion. This is part of a process. Second, this assumes you have a good relationship

150
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:52,480
with your manager. All of us are in different situations at work. Throughout my career,

151
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,120
I have had amazing managers, I have had average managers, and I've had a few awful managers.

152
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,240
Sometimes you're going to be in a situation where it is not going to matter what you do.

153
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,120
You are going to be stuck dealing with a manager who is not going to promote you. So one thing

154
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,500
you have to learn is to watch for the red flags in your organization and make sure that

155
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,600
you trust your manager to have your back. Now, having your back doesn't mean just promoting

156
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,880
you. Having your back means that they're willing to have the conversations with you that are

157
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,720
tough conversations where they might point out where you still need to work stuff. So

158
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,960
you need somebody who will look out for you, push you when you're ready, and help you when

159
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:48,160
you're not. Second, remember when I mentioned that I'm a mother, an introvert, and have

160
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,920
diagnosed ADHD? Please don't think because I talk about the system that I have implemented

161
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:06,040
even close to perfectly. Last review period, I got so busy, I never even submitted my self-reflection.

162
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:13,880
My Brag document is often reconstructed backwards every few months after combing through Slack,

163
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,240
email, Google Docs, and any other source I can find to dig out what have I worked on

164
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,780
recently and why did I not remember to write it all down this time. Sometimes I've even

165
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,760
forgotten about it so much to the point where I can't reconstruct it, and I just have to

166
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,160
kind of declare, just like you'll declare I'm done with this inbox and wipe it to zero,

167
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,840
I'll declare Brag's Doc deletion and start over from scratch. The point I want to make

168
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,360
is I don't want you to judge yourself if you can't hit this ideal I'm talking about. You

169
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,400
do not have to do this 100% to get yourself promoted. The goal is to aim for this, and

170
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,480
any amount of work you can do on this on the way helps. The other goal is to remember that

171
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,760
part of your job is to prioritize yourself and prioritize the time at work to take care

172
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,480
of yourself, and that means doing things like documenting your work, talking to your manager

173
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,600
about it, and making sure they know what you've done a great job at. Thank you. Thank you,

174
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,320
Vicki, and thank you everyone at NormComp for a chance to give this talk. The blog post

175
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:59,320
this is lightly based on is located on my very rarely updated blog.
