1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
This is the opposite of transformers.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,480
This is the Zen of tedium,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,940
or how I learned to stop worrying and love doing things the hard way.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,380
First off, I got to get it out of the way.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,620
There are some really valid reasons to avoid doing things the hard way.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,180
The first of these is some things just take too long.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,620
When we take our pup to the vet,

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,580
we like to walk her, weather permitting,

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,340
and if she's not in a bad way,

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:40,660
it's a nice stroll through the Boston Public Garden and down a tree-lined pedestrian mall.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,180
It takes longer and we might be a little sweaty and a little dirty when we get there.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,740
But doing it the hard way is so much more satisfying than getting a car,

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,500
popping in, popping out.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,460
But if I was going to check in at the home office in Sunnydale,

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,420
I would not walk.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,720
However pleasant it might be,

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,860
it would be too long,

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,700
it would defeat the purpose.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,820
When we have code bases that are millions of lines long,

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,780
or tables that have trillions of rows,

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,540
a lot of times it's just not worth our while to do things the hard way.

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,740
That's a valid excuse.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,300
Another one is, we're going to push back on this later,

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,340
but the flip side is sometimes,

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,060
legitimately, I could be using my brain to solve more valuable problems.

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,500
If my job is to copy and paste cells from

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,340
one spreadsheet to another spreadsheet in a similar way over and over again,

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,740
I can legitimately argue that, hey,

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,420
if I write a tool to automate this,

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,060
then I can get it up and going and I could do things that might add

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,140
a little more value to the team,

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,580
to the department, to the company.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,620
That's totally fair, totally legitimate thing to do.

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,980
Another valid reason to avoid doing things the hard way is,

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,380
sometimes we have to, it's part of playing the game.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,740
The high point of my Twitter career was this tweet right here.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,940
It said, ML strategy tip.

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,020
When you have a problem, build two solutions.

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,220
One is a deep Bayesian transformer running on multi-Cloud Kubernetes,

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,700
and the other is a SQL query built on a stack of egregiously oversimplifying assumptions.

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,660
You put one on your resume and the other in production and everybody's happy.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,420
There is sometimes a justification for doing things the fancy way,

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,860
the automated way, the slick way,

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,900
for your promotion packet or

45
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,620
for your next position that you're trying to get hired for.

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,900
I don't like it, but it's the truth.

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,580
Now, there are, got to call out,

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,380
there are some less than valid reasons to avoid doing things the hard way.

49
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,420
The first of these is the fallacy that doing a thing manually is a moral failing.

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,140
Picture that you have a service or something that you're

51
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,900
in charge of making sure it's healthy and running.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,500
So you get a few metrics like how long it takes to return a response,

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,180
what fraction of the time it's up,

54
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,620
what the volume of requests are that it's getting.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,660
You make a little dashboard that you can track these things day to day.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,300
You have a nice visual heartbeat health monitor right there.

57
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,020
One approach is you sit down at your desk every morning,

58
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,220
you pull these things up,

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,700
you scroll through them, you take a look,

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,580
and you get a feeling that yes,

61
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,500
everything is working as it should.

62
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,940
Some misguided souls will tell you,

63
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,500
hey, we don't do things every day.

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,340
We're engineers.

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,980
We write tools for that.

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,580
We automate that.

67
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,140
Sure enough, there are tools that you can go in and set alerts.

68
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,300
So if any of those limits are to fall too low or go too high,

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,140
you can set an alert for that.

70
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,700
If any of them change too much in one day,

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
you can set an alert for that too.

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,100
You can even get fancy and if two or three of them change in

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,340
some concerted pattern that is worrying for some reason,

74
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,740
you can set an alert for that too.

75
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,340
Then you turn the thing on and forget about it and walk away.

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,420
Life is good. You've solved the problem.

77
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,700
Now, when you do that, there are three things that could happen.

78
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,300
One is you get some alerts that something went wrong,

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,860
and you go and you open it up,

80
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,060
and you realize, well,

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,300
yeah, sure, that one was high,

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,500
but it was a Saturday and it was World Cup.

83
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,340
We'd expect that one to be high.

84
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,180
Not really a problem.

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,580
Another thing that can happen is you don't get an alert,

86
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,780
but you hear from a very disgruntled VP a few days later,

87
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,740
what's wrong, and you go and you look and you're like,

88
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,700
oh, no, I see what happened.

89
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,820
I didn't think to set an alert for

90
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,180
exactly this set of circumstances,

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,220
but if I had been looking for it, I would have seen it.

92
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,580
The third thing that can happen is

93
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,880
your system that does this automated alert check can silently fail,

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,860
and then you don't know if your service is healthy or not.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,980
You've got nothing. You're flying blind.

96
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,460
Now, there are engineering solutions to all of these things.

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,100
They're not unsolvable,

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,780
but don't fall for the trap that there's an easy solution to wrap this up.

99
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,860
Especially, don't fall for the line that it's

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,540
wrong to pop it open and look at it with your own eyeballs every morning.

101
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,940
Another mistaken belief is that manual tasks are beneath me, beneath any of us.

102
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,020
No, I'm not going to do it the hard way.

103
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,340
Do you know what my title is?

104
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,460
There are other people who do that.

105
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,780
We have contractors who do that.

106
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,420
We have grad students do that.

107
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,180
Sorry, grad students.

108
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,460
We have people who somehow are suited to that and should do that,

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,180
because I shouldn't have to worry about it.

110
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,500
I build models.

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
I deploy things in production.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:25,260
I call bullshit. Any job that needs to be done is fair game for any of us.

113
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,820
Yes, we specialize.

114
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,100
Some things take a long time to get comfortable with, that's fine.

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,860
But if sweeping the floor is what needs to

116
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,780
happen to get the product out the door, then we sweep the floor.

117
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,380
If you like to eat, you learn to cook.

118
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,580
If you like to build models, you spend time labeling data.

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,060
You don't assume that someone is going to take care of those dirty details for you.

120
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,340
Finally, this one can bring up feelings, busyness.

121
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,660
When you sit down to do a task the hard way,

122
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,540
often there's a repetitive nature to it.

123
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,940
Our apex executive functions aren't always needed for that.

124
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,540
We can set those offline.

125
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,460
While we're paging through the documentation for our software tools,

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,140
making sure all the functions are well-represented and properly typed,

127
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:25,220
then that allows another part of our brain to kick back and say,

128
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,620
oh, you know what, I'm so behind, I owe so many emails,

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,340
and I need to review that paper,

130
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,420
and I got to get that grant proposal in,

131
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,420
and I need to write those letters of recommendation.

132
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,500
That's legitimate because most of us are oversubscribed.

133
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,140
But the jump that's easy to make there is,

134
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,500
therefore, I should not be spending time on this task.

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,460
I shouldn't be doing it the hard way.

136
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,020
There's got to be a better way.

137
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,740
It should be automated, or it should be delegated,

138
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,260
or something, like it shouldn't happen.

139
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,780
I'm going to skip it. I'm going to find a way out.

140
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,220
It's oftentimes like if we've got a task,

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,420
the best direct path through it is just to take a deep breath and keep going.

142
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,020
Do it the hard way, get it out of the way, then move on.

143
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,140
Now, the busyness is a big problem,

144
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,380
and the solution to that is do less stuff.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
And if you want to know about that,

146
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,740
you'll have to come to the next NormConf,

147
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,100
which I'm told will be in 2015.

148
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,500
Now, there is a handful of reasons to love doing things the hard way.

149
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,540
So this same phenomenon of our apex cognitive functions,

150
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,820
getting a break, is a bonus, because like any muscle,

151
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,420
this thing gets tired.

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,740
We have so many hours in the day, but brain hours, we have far fewer.

153
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,380
Like if you're really good, you've got four, maybe five peak brain hours.

154
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,060
I'm probably down to two.

155
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,580
Like you only have so much that you can really work with.

156
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,460
And so if you're doing something that's a little bit by the book,

157
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,380
a little bit repetitive, checking the labels on your data set,

158
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,340
you can let that part of your brain rest for an hour, 90 minutes.

159
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,820
Then when you're done, you come out, you're ready to scheme and plan

160
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,700
and pitch and strategize, and you can jump right back in.

161
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,340
Another one is flow.

162
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,820
So when you get into a task that is a little bit repetitive

163
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,940
and has a little bit of a restricted domain,

164
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,700
a beautiful thing can happen where it's like if your brain is a processor

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,340
and you have your L1 and your L2 cache,

166
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,140
you can cache all of the concepts and the relationships and the connections

167
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,900
and just have them right there at your fingertips.

168
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,500
And so it's almost at that point like you're spinning magic,

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,940
like you don't have to go digging and dredging for these things.

170
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,340
You're just like constructing it like Elsa with an ice castle,

171
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,660
like you just have it right there.

172
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,740
When there's a good flow when I'm coding,

173
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,100
it's one of the best feelings in the world.

174
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,580
Now, I have strong feelings about large language models.

175
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,060
When I'm coding, I feel like there's maybe a dozen paths ahead of me

176
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,300
at any given time, and the game is I'm thinking a couple steps forward

177
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,580
on each one, like, well, is this a good way to represent this?

178
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
How might it play with this other part of the system?

179
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,180
How might it play with this other part I'm planning to write in the future?

180
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,180
And then I'll inch forward, write a line or two,

181
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,540
and then I'll repeat that again, and there's this repeated fan,

182
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,540
kind of a fractal fan out ahead of me.

183
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,180
If I write an informative comment and use that as a prompt

184
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,220
to a large language model and it spits out a function for me,

185
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,300
that's like it picks one road from beginning to end and says,

186
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,420
use this, I'm confident that it's right.

187
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,300
This is absolutely the way to do it, get obsessed.

188
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,220
Now my thought process is totally hijacked.

189
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,500
Instead, I'm evaluating at every tiny step,

190
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,180
well, was this the right name for this variable?

191
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,980
Was it the right type to assign to it?

192
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,700
Did I want to put this in a function or maybe like abstract it out

193
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,540
or maybe just put a couple lines in line in this other function?

194
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,340
But you're focused on this proposed path,

195
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,980
which can entirely distract you from something else,

196
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,620
and you're forced to switch context very quickly.

197
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,180
It breaks flow.

198
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
So this is an instance where for me, at least,

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,580
doing it the hard way is a beautiful thing.

200
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,220
Another benefit is sometimes it is faster.

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,460
It is better use of time.

202
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,260
As always, Randall Monroe, XKCD, has our back on this,

203
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,180
little back of the envelope calculation.

204
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,140
How often you do a task, how much time you're going to save off

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,220
if you automate it, and then if you plan to do this task for five years,

206
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,340
how much time can you invest and break even?

207
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,980
Nick HK on Twitter, he said we could use this tweet.

208
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,700
He says, I stopped using a reference manager a few years ago

209
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,900
and just put together a bib by hand for each new paper.

210
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,460
I don't really miss it.

211
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,580
Maintaining it was more work than it saved.

212
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,300
My personal version of the bib file is I've got a laptop with Linux on it.

213
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,860
When I sit down at my desk, I like to plug it into a big monitor

214
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,500
so I can see all of my bright red errors much larger.

215
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,820
Because Linux is what it is, it doesn't automatically detect the monitor,

216
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,700
so I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time my laptop goes to sleep.

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Linux being what it is, I know that if I were to invest enough time,

218
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,660
I could change the right config file or update the right driver,

219
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,060
and it would fix the problem, automatically detect it like magic every time.

220
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,940
But doing some quick math on how long this takes and how many times I do it,

221
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,700
even if I invested an hour in that task, it would take me years to pay it off.

222
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,660
So I do it the hard way.

223
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,340
I just unplug it and plug it back in.

224
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,780
I don't have to think about it.

225
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,940
It just happens.

226
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,140
Related to this, doing things the hard way ensures focus.

227
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,340
The myth on top, again, from Randall Munroe, I'm working on a task.

228
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,300
Oh, I should automate this.

229
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,060
You write some code, automation takes over.

230
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,460
Boom, free time.

231
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,460
You can meme that much more.

232
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,860
In reality, you write the code, and you get a great 80% solution,

233
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,980
and you're excited.

234
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,140
Like, this is a legitimate win.

235
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,340
This is OKR success.

236
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,860
But you're still spending time on the original task.

237
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,340
It's not very satisfying in that sense.

238
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,260
So you rethink it, you refactor, you go back, you debug.

239
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,860
You get it up to a 95% solution.

240
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,380
Like, that's really good.

241
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,340
That is an A level of effort.

242
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
But you haven't gotten rid of the original task.

243
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,740
You still have to monitor it, and you still

244
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,300
have to go back to it and take care of the other corner cases.

245
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,660
So you're lying in your bed at 3 in the morning,

246
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,540
you're staring at the ceiling, and you say, oh, I got it.

247
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,460
If I solve this previously unsolved computer science problem,

248
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,940
I can get it up to five nines of completion, at which point I can walk away.

249
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,020
And I had a flash of inspiration for how to do this.

250
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,340
And so you jump in with both feet, you work on this problem,

251
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
you make a little headway, you publish a paper,

252
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,340
you get recognized for it, you get a new position at another institution,

253
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,100
and the original task is never touched again.

254
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,180
And you live happily ever after.

255
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,380
Maybe not what you're going for.

256
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,620
The task is a failure.

257
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,420
One of my favorites here is for doing things the hard way,

258
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,060
sometimes there's no other way.

259
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,020
My favorite example of this is feature engineering.

260
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,020
I have to give respect to the AutoML tools who take all the features

261
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,140
and in a lot of clever ways combine them to get plausibly engineered features

262
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,860
and test them for predictive power.

263
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,620
But at the end of the day, there's too many possibilities.

264
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,780
There's too many permutations, too many functions you can use to combine these things.

265
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,180
There's no way you can automate all that.

266
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,180
And they often require knowing things that aren't in the data set.

267
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,500
You have to know what you're measuring.

268
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,540
You have to know how it interacts with the other pieces,

269
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,820
often physically what's behind it.

270
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,220
Sometimes you have to know exactly the details of how it was measured.

271
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,460
I had one situation where you actually had to know who made each measurement

272
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,020
so that you would know how to properly interpret it and make a good feature out of it.

273
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,500
There's no shortcut for that.

274
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,460
Doing it the hard way is the only way sometimes.

275
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,940
And then finally, this is the last one, serendipity.

276
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,020
It is totally valid when you need to get from point A to point B

277
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,620
to find the nearest on-ramp, blaze down the freeway,

278
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,700
listen to some tunes, hop off the off-ramp, and you're there.

279
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,740
You're done.

280
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,220
You saw some concrete and mission accomplished.

281
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,340
But it's not the only way to do it.

282
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,060
Sometimes you can take the long way, you can take the slow way, the hard way,

283
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,540
and go by some back roads.

284
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,500
When you do, you'll see some things.

285
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,820
In The Hobbit, Thorin Oakenshield says,

286
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
there's nothing like looking if you want to find something.

287
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,380
You certainly usually find something if you look,

288
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,740
but it's not always quite the something you were after.

289
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,660
Now, he said this to Fili and Kili,

290
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,460
because they were getting rained on and danger of getting crushed to death by some giants.

291
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,540
Fili and Kili went and found a dry cave, which was a win.

292
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,380
Now, it happened to be a golf course,

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,660
but it was a cave, which was a win.

294
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,700
Now, it happened to be a goblin-infested cave in the Misty Mountains,

295
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,260
and they got kidnapped, but everything turned out OK in the end.

296
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,700
They found something, but it wasn't quite the something they were after,

297
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,460
and they were the better for it.

298
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,460
My favorite example of this is when you get a new data set,

299
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,420
so you have a CSV, pull up the data set or a manageable portion of it in a spreadsheet,

300
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,940
just look at the columns.

301
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,860
What are they labeled? Do they even make sense?

302
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,660
Are there repeated names? Are there missing names?

303
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,500
Are there entirely and utterly cryptic names?

304
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,940
Look at the rows.

305
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,820
Are there columns that have the same value for every row?

306
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,860
Are there columns that are like 99% missing?

307
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,900
Are there columns with states in the United States

308
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,940
where some are capitalized and some are not?

309
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,860
Actually ran across that pretty recently.

310
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,700
Are there columns that tend to be missing together

311
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,220
or tend to change in the same way together?

312
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,940
Are there half a dozen different representations for missing values?

313
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,580
Every single time I've done this, I've found things,

314
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,060
seen things, found the answers to questions I didn't even think to ask.

315
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
You'll find something.

316
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,580
It won't always be quite the something you were after,

317
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,260
but you'll find it and you'll be the better for it.

318
00:18:53,260 --> 00:19:01,100
And in my experience, this getting elbows deep in the code, in the data,

319
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,500
this is the path from competency to expertise.

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,180
I hope that you find your own Zen of tedium and have a good time doing it.

321
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:24,700
Thank you.
