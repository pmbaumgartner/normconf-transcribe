1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Some of you guys may know me.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,120
I run my mouth on Twitter because I have adult ADHD

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,580
and that's just exactly my drug of choice.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,040
I'm now hanging out on Mastodon,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,680
but I haven't left Twitter either.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,180
So you guys may know me from kind of either place.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,840
More importantly than me running my mouth too much

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,400
and having been around data stuff for a while is in,

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,400
in, let's see, I would have, I was born in 1972.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,400
So Christmas of 1980, I was eight years old

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,760
and stuck under my bed in the place

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,200
that would later hold Victoria's Secret catalogs

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
was actually stuck at that point in my life,

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
the Lego catalog.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,840
And the Lego catalog was dog-eared

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
and this was the Lego kit that 1980 version of me

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,680
wanted more than any,

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,360
this was my Red Ryder BB gun of 1980.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,820
And in Christmas morning, 1980,

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,480
I came downstairs and Santa Claus had brought this Lego kit

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,940
and it was the apex Lego experience of my life.

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,500
And I'm not even sure if my parents know this,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,080
but I'll make sure they watch this video and know this.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,240
And actually my only regret was every other Christmas

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
for the rest of my life has been somewhat

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,600
of a disappointment compared to getting this kit

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,720
with the actual motor and it changed gears

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
and it even went in reverse.

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,580
And I was eight years old, right?

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,800
So by the time I got in middle school

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,320
and taking physics class,

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,840
I thought that the people who thought the engine spun

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
in the other direction when you put it in reverse,

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,400
I thought they were brain damaged

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,840
because that was beyond intuitive to me

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
because I had been building actual little transmissions

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,680
with gears since I was eight years old.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Anyway, I mentioned Lego and Lego being the apex toy

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,560
because much to my pleasant surprise,

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,560
last year in Nature Magazine,

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,880
Adam Converse, Hales and Klotz had a paper

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,200
that had a Lego example.

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,600
They did actual work with humans

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,960
and it had a Lego problem in the middle of it.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,560
So I'm immediately interested

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
because we know Lego are the apex toy.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,480
So in their paper, they gave participants in a study

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
the Lego arrangement you see on the left.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,320
Actually, it wasn't a Lego minifigure.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
They had a Star Wars character

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,480
and I'll show it to you in a minute in the next slide.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,120
When it got published for copyright reasons,

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
they couldn't put the Star Wars Stormtrooper in there.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,080
So I think actually in the, I got the paper right here.

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,420
I think they do just a little drawing

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,600
with figurine removed.

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
But anyway, it looked like the thing on the left.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
And what they asked participants first, yeah,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
they don't even have the figurine in here.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,800
It's just a placeholder.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,320
What they asked participants to do is said,

62
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
okay, take this Lego model

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,680
and make it so that we can put this brick

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,760
on top of that top part

65
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
and it not crush the figurine.

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,920
That was the first challenge they gave folks.

67
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
And so you can imagine,

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,440
and you guys should do this in your head.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,780
Imagine you've got these blocks, you've got this figurine,

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,640
you've got this Lego arrangement.

71
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,080
How do you arrange this so you can put the block on,

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
or sorry, the brick on top of the Lego blocks

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,800
and not crush the figurine?

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,860
All right, so think about that.

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,060
And that's actually how it looked in real life.

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,960
So like the next cycle of this,

77
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,240
they say, okay, we're gonna give you a dollar

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,280
to solve this problem,

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,760
but each additional block costs 10 cents

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,360
and it's gotta hold this brick on top.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
So think about how you might solve that.

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,360
All right, so you might put three more blocks on there.

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,240
You'll be down 30 cents, still make 70 cents, right?

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,320
There's other ways you might've solved.

85
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
You might try to put just one in the corner

86
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
and hope they put the brick on really square

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
so it balances.

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,800
Anyway, they also in a third round prompted people

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,480
with just the phrase, removing a block has no cost.

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Now think about this yourself.

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,280
How would you have solved this Lego problem

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
if I prompt you with removing a block has no cost?

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,540
Now, I wish I could see the whole audience.

94
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,980
If you're in the chat over here,

95
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,440
I've got the general tab open.

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Let me know if you changed your mind

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,680
when I said removing a block has no cost

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,680
because a huge number of respondents in this study did

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,240
because the default action

100
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,440
was to think about adding something.

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,120
And they discovered that it was only through prompting

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,760
and they had to do pretty strong prompts.

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,840
They could get people to think about removing

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
and people would see it.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,840
And then they would begin to choose subtracting.

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,120
And it was kind of like the big surprise

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,480
of this whole paper is additive ideas come to mind quickly

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,280
and easily, but subtractive ideas

109
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
require more cognitive effort.

110
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,080
So they decided to test this with a bunch of stuff

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,800
that boringly weren't Lego blocks.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
I don't know why,

113
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,160
but they tested it with things like recipes.

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
So if we give people a recipe and say,

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,560
how do you make this better?

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Almost nobody removed something from the recipe.

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,960
What they do is they add something.

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,760
The exception to that is if they had something ridiculous

119
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,440
in the recipe that folks will be like,

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
oh, right, yeah, remove that.

121
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,600
That doesn't belong, you know,

122
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,320
something savory doesn't belong in the dessert, right?

123
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,600
Like it would be better if you subtracted that.

124
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,500
But outside of kind of the ridiculous,

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,880
people don't see subtracting something for a recipe

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
as a way to get it better.

127
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,480
And trust me, every recipe that I have ever made

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,560
that I got offline, after I made it,

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm like half this crap, we don't need it.

130
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
And we can simplify it dramatically

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
by just like not doing all these steps.

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,580
It's almost like they think people won't enjoy it

133
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,040
if they don't do a lot of complicated steps.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Similarly, the study took that this nation

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
that mentioned in this nature paper,

136
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,500
they took a bunch of vacation plans

137
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,460
and put them in front of people

138
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,160
and said, make these vacation plans better.

139
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,240
And most folks default is to add an activity.

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,360
Now, my wife and I would have had that tendency

141
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,000
and we had a kid who is now 15 and we later learned,

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
you know, we have a lot more fun

143
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,080
if we try to do one thing in the morning

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,340
and maybe one thing in the afternoon,

145
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,100
but make the thing in the afternoon, like optional,

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,160
so that like no charge to cancel,

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,860
so that we can punch out if things start going bad.

148
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,480
Like that's how we discovered how to have happy holidays

149
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,560
and good vacations.

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
But if you give people just an agenda,

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,760
they will try to shove more stuff into it.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,920
And it's because this is human nature,

153
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,560
which as I looked around and thought about it,

154
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
I realized I see this kind of everywhere.

155
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,520
And this is a little bit like getting a new car

156
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,600
of a certain type.

157
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,620
You will begin to see these everywhere.

158
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,040
Once I have primed you for subtractive thinking is hard

159
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,640
and people don't tend to do it,

160
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,580
you will begin to see this everywhere.

161
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,660
So that's my Santa gift to you all

162
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,020
is introducing this idea of subtractive thinking

163
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,480
and allowing you to see how hard it is,

164
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,820
but that there's great benefit.

165
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,640
So let's look at a few examples,

166
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,500
other things where subtractive thinking comes in play.

167
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
Or as my 15 year old daughter says,

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,080
cool story, bro, but why do we care?

169
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,980
Well, we have already seen mention

170
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,440
of this minimum viable product diagram,

171
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,340
at least in the chat.

172
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,800
I don't know if it made it into one of the presentations,

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
but for those of you who haven't seen it,

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,200
the general idea is if you design products,

175
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,120
it are incrementally where they aren't useful

176
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,380
until you get to the very end,

177
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,360
basically your customers are unhappy with you

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,520
the whole time until the very end,

179
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,120
except the reality we all know is at step four,

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,200
they look at you because that was not what they wanted.

181
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,220
So actually it doesn't even work this way.

182
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,640
This is like a stylized positive version.

183
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,820
The real way is, or I'm sorry,

184
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,820
the MVP way that Henrik Kynberg recommends

185
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,640
in his, what is Scrum is this thing that's become iconic,

186
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,520
where you give somebody a skateboard

187
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,740
and it's not super happy,

188
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,480
but you give them a little bit more

189
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,400
and it kind of becomes useful.

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,960
And iteratively, we add a couple more features

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
and we get iteratively more useful,

192
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,040
but they don't hate it all the way through.

193
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Well, what is this exercise other than reducing down

194
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,840
what is the minimum thing we can give somebody

195
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,080
that they get positive utility from?

196
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,040
I just slipped into economics talk,

197
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,000
but that they're somewhat happy with,

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
what is the minimum thing we can give them?

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,140
And then we ask, what is the next marginal improvement?

200
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,720
Oh my God, I did it again.

201
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,920
What is the next marginal improvement

202
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,480
that we can make on this thing

203
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,560
to make it a little bit more useful?

204
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,200
Okay, so this is this exercise

205
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,880
in reductive subtractive thinking,

206
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,440
where we are trying to figure out

207
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,440
what's the least we can do to make the most positive value.

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
So the whole minimum viable product exercise

209
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,100
is really just to try to trick your brain

210
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,160
into subtractive thinking.

211
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,120
Some of you may see,

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
I gave a presentation some years ago on empathy

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and I presented the thesis that in Agile, the user story,

214
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,360
what that really is, is a hack

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,120
to get you to be empathetic with a specific user, right?

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,680
But we make it a specific user,

217
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,480
we narrow down what it is we're talking about.

218
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,320
And we introduce this hack of the user story

219
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
and it forces empathy.

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,340
It becomes a forcing function for empathy

221
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,200
in the mind of a software developer.

222
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,920
I think the minimum viable product

223
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,880
is a forcing function for reductive thinking

224
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
that we interject into our development processes

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,240
in order to prime and pump us

226
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
for this effective way of thinking, which is reductive.

227
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,620
When what our brains kind of want to do is be additive.

228
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,960
So it's a subtractive prompt.

229
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,220
And remember from our first part of this presentation,

230
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,880
prompting is incredibly important

231
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
because we're actually open to subtractive thinking.

232
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,780
We're not morally opposed to it.

233
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,680
It's just not like our default mind state.

234
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,480
And so having prompts is super useful.

235
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,000
And I think that's why the MVP,

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,840
part of why the MVP model has gotten so highly adopted

237
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,540
is it's effective because we're responsive to prompts.

238
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,800
All right, so let's think about more reductive things.

239
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,280
A few of you may have seen my comment online

240
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,160
where I talk about reading through an answer

241
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,480
on Stack Overflow, and please ignore my spelling errors.

242
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
And I thought, wow, that's a really great answer.

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,680
And I really learned some things

244
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
and I got down to the bottom

245
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,880
and I discovered it was my answer

246
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,200
that I wrote eight years ago.

247
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
All right, so besides being kind of comically silly

248
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,360
that I would read something I wrote

249
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,480
and not even recognize it as my own writing,

250
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,000
the one of the things that this reminded me of

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is the way I ended up writing so much on Stack Overflow

252
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,680
was that I just happened to be there when it started.

253
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,680
And I was just learning R as Stack Overflow was starting.

254
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,040
And one of the things a handful of us did,

255
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,640
and actually, Chris, I had forgotten

256
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,740
you were involved in this

257
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,560
because I found notes relatively recently.

258
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,440
And I had completely forgotten, I didn't know you then.

259
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
And by the way, long-time listener, first-time caller,

260
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
this is the first time Chris and I

261
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,520
have ever talked in real voice,

262
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,720
although we have traded messages on and off

263
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,660
over the last years and years.

264
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,000
But Chris was there, Mike Driscoll,

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,960
who's with RealData, RealR-I-L-L-Data,

266
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,000
and they just launched product this week.

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,560
Mike Driscoll and I helped prime Stack Overflow

268
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,960
with R questions because there weren't many R questions,

269
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,520
and we felt like the R discussion list online,

270
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,720
the email list, was not super helpful for learners.

271
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,400
And so we got a bunch of questions

272
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
that had been asked on other R discussion forums

273
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,420
and things that had been put into a search engine

274
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,000
of a popular R site,

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,040
and we turned them into questions for Stack Overflow.

276
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
And then we just divided it up.

277
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
A bunch of people posted questions,

278
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,760
a bunch of people answered questions,

279
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,760
and we seeded the R tag on Stack Overflow.

280
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
So I was sort of there at the beginning in a bunch of ways,

281
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,820
and I haven't answered or asked

282
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,280
a Stack Overflow question in years,

283
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,000
but I was real active early on.

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
And one of the things I did

285
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,400
is every time I was learning something,

286
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,440
it was R, then later it was Pandas,

287
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,580
as I began to use more Python as Pandas came on.

288
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,040
And I started to ask more questions,

289
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,880
and I had developed the skill of reducing

290
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,640
my thinking and my question

291
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,240
down to something fairly specific.

292
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,840
And that allowed me to answer a good question

293
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,680
that could be answered.

294
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,160
And over time, this got a name.

295
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
This began to be called a reprex,

296
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
or a reproducible example,

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,020
and began to be called that.

298
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,520
And as a matter of fact, Jenny Bryan,

299
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,520
who did one of the lightning talks about naming things,

300
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,840
Jenny Bryan has a library for R called reprex

301
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,120
for helping make these easier to make.

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Reprexes are an exercise in reductive thinking.

303
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,560
They're unreasonably effective

304
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,780
because when you write a reprex,

305
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,880
it's a type of debugging.

306
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
If you have a problem

307
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,200
and you're writing a reproducible example,

308
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
it is akin to rubber duck debugging

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,820
in that the process of reducing your question down

310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,680
to a minimum viable example,

311
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
you actually a lot of times,

312
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,480
well, I actually a lot of times,

313
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,560
discover what I was doing wrong or what the problem is

314
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,220
before I ever answer the question,

315
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,320
because I get all the noise

316
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,080
of everything else I was working on out of the way,

317
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,520
and I get down to the brass tacks of what the problem is,

318
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,320
and then I'm like, oh, dumbass, there it is.

319
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,500
And it just jumps out at me.

320
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,680
Now, sometimes it doesn't,

321
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,960
and I'm able to share it online on Stack Overflow

322
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,000
with my team in a Slack, wherever,

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,040
and somebody else can just copy, paste it

324
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,800
into their editor, run it,

325
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,520
and be like, oh, dude, here you go.

326
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Here's what's going on.

327
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
And like, oh, I see now that matrix was shaped

328
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,200
the opposite of what I thought it was or whatever.

329
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,400
So you can get more eyes on the problem quickly

330
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,980
because you allow someone else

331
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,560
to understand your problem more quickly.

332
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,800
That's reductive to get there, and it's hard.

333
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,760
It's gotta be explicitly taught, right?

334
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,120
When analysts come in and start working with us,

335
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,560
they often sit down with me with a problem

336
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,280
that is too complicated for me

337
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
to understand what they're doing,

338
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
and they're a little surprised

339
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,880
because they've got this whole course of knowledge problem.

340
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,620
They understand what's going on on the screen.

341
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,240
They can't believe that I can't

342
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
because I'm smarter than them from their point of view.

343
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,600
I should be able to understand it.

344
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,280
And so I always give them as a challenge,

345
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,280
hey, let's do this as an exercise first

346
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,480
in reducing and focusing your question down

347
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
and creating a reprex.

348
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,160
So I'm a huge fan of reprexes

349
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,640
as a type of reductive thinking.

350
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Now, I'd went through this exercise recently with Coiled,

351
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,120
who they're a company that supports

352
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,740
and employs a number of Dask contributors.

353
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,960
And I had a Dask problem that wasn't working well.

354
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,320
We actually hired them to come in where I work

355
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,880
and partner with us and work on a problem we had.

356
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
And I've shared this story elsewhere,

357
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,560
but at the end of it, they said,

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,640
hey, this was kind of an interesting problem

359
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,120
and showed a limitation or a challenge in Dask

360
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,580
because it was a big, like unbalanced join,

361
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,000
and it was a mini to mini join.

362
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
It was just gnarly behaved problem.

363
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
It just didn't flow well through anything.

364
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,920
And they're like, hey, can we have your data,

365
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
like anonymize it more and let's use it?

366
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,900
And I said, actually, no, but I can make dummy data

367
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,720
that acts, I think I understand this problem enough

368
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
to make dummy data that acts like this real data.

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,280
And I just went in and worked with them and we created,

370
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,640
and this is all public on GitHub,

371
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,720
we created a reproducible example of this dummy dataset

372
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,600
that's got 4 billion records.

373
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
Now, this is an awful lot,

374
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,480
what Julia Silgi talked about

375
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,680
with making simulated data to learn something.

376
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,360
Well, I made simulated data to match a real problem,

377
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,960
but I did it because I could make it public.

378
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,800
And then we could use that as a test

379
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,600
against different distributed platforms.

380
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,260
I mean, Coiled can use it against Dask.

381
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,200
Somebody else may wanna play with it against Spark

382
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,080
to make Spark better.

383
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,640
Great, everybody wins, right?

384
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,600
It's a certain class of challenging problem.

385
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,880
But that is a type of reductive thinking.

386
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,840
We had to go through the process of figuring out

387
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,240
what was it about my problem that made it difficult or hard?

388
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,580
And then we had to reproduce that.

389
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,600
That was largely a reductive exercise.

390
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,080
It wasn't this, it wasn't that,

391
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,920
it's only these facets of the problem.

392
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,520
And then we created simulated data

393
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,320
to represent those parts of the problem at scale.

394
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,520
Super useful.

395
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,000
So I'm a big fan of Adam Savage.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
And what could be more norm core

397
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,940
than every tool is a hammer?

398
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,720
I kind of psychologically made my way through COVID

399
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,980
by laying underneath an old Jeep,

400
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,920
getting various motor fluids in my face.

401
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,520
And part of the time I was doing this,

402
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,720
I was listening to Adam Savage's book.

403
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,480
And one of the things that really jumped out at me

404
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,840
in the book is he talks about buying material

405
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,400
to build everything he builds three times.

406
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,880
So he goes into a build

407
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,420
knowing he's gonna build it three times.

408
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,560
The first time you work the kinks out

409
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
and you just sort of figure out how it works.

410
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,200
The second time you get a really good version,

411
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
but it isn't camera perfect.

412
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,000
And he makes props for movies, so it has to be camera perfect.

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
So after the second time,

414
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,620
he then knows enough to build it the third time

415
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,040
and get it camera perfect.

416
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,900
And I think this is part of a reductive thinking

417
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,000
is not planning the first time we do something

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,020
to boil the ocean.

419
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,320
And that was mentioned in the presentation right before me

420
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,760
about not trying to do everything.

421
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,840
Like just get your logic flowing through a system

422
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
and then figure out where your performance bottlenecks are.

423
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,200
That's a certain type of reductive thinking.

424
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
So to repeat myself,

425
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,980
subtractive or reductive thinking is not our default.

426
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,160
It's hard.

427
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
Prompting to think subtractive helps considerably.

428
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
We can be prompted.

429
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
MVPs are a great prompt to think about reducing

430
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,460
or subtracting things.

431
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,480
Reproducible examples are a critical meta skill

432
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,380
that are reductive.

433
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,480
Refactor for simplicity,

434
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,360
reduce it down is a really good use case

435
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,840
of subtractive thinking.

436
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,000
And even taking out code and using a library

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,680
that someone else maintains,

438
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,940
that's even subtractive thinking.

439
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,200
So on that note, I had listed some job openings.

440
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,680
They're also in the chat, in the Slack.

441
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,920
So let me stop sharing and we'll do Q&A.
