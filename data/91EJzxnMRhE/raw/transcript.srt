1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
I am going to talk a little bit about my experience

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,800
about being sort of staff citizen

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,800
or a senior engineer at Twitter and how my job changed.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,000
So a little bit about me,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,960
I, you know, in a previous life,

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,760
I had a PhD in math after some soul searching

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,320
or life crisis as some other people might call it.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
I did what many people in that situation would do,

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,160
which is go to find a software job.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
After a few years, I moved to San Francisco

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,660
to do data science for a conversion and ad company.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,840
And in the past five and a half years ago,

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,880
I have been at Twitter where I co-founded

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,480
the Machine Learning Ethics Transparency

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,880
and Accountability Team.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,880
And I operated as a capacity of tech lead

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
for a research lead for the team.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,820
And sort of like this talk really came,

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,000
I started thinking more about leadership for ICs

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,580
during my time at Twitter.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,480
And so maybe if there is one thing that I want you

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,020
to remember in the spirit of this conference is this name.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,320
So we'll, it's a little bit more nuanced than this,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,320
but when people talk about a manager in an IC

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,680
sort of career, they are presented usually very separately.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,120
However, what I'm hoping to convince you

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,840
is that they're actually not as different

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,180
as people claim them to be.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,520
So maybe let me start with some disclaimers.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,520
This is not a talk about what being a staff plus IC mean.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,400
There has been books and blogs

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
and many other resources being about that.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,140
So this is not about that.

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,000
This is also not a talk to convince you to be an IC

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,960
or not to be an IC, or if you should be a manager

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
or you should not be a manager.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
I don't have anything against manager.

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Manager are awesome.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,780
Having a great manager really helps.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,660
Of course, there are not everyone is a great manager,

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,120
but that's true for everyone.

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
And so, I have talked about, I've used these words,

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,600
like IC is geriatric IC, like what does the word mean?

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,960
So let's start maybe by defining them.

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,480
So IC is short for individual contributor,

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,800
is someone who in, usually in tech companies

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
is a person who might ship code or do analysis.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Roughly speaking, we can think as someone

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
who consumes your stories.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
For the purpose of this talk,

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360
we'll consider a geriatric IC or senior citizen,

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
someone who is equal or above,

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,760
of course, that depends on the role

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,680
and the company senior level.

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,640
And sometimes these roles are called staff or principal

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,000
and senior level in most companies consider

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,580
sort of like to be the final level,

58
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,080
meaning that if you want, you can stay at that level

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,200
without sort of getting flagged for performance,

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
lack of performance.

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,760
A manager, as we might know,

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
but I just wanna make it clear,

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,240
is someone who manages people, has like little direct reports

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,260
and so usually is responsible for the team.

65
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,320
Of course, it's not always like,

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,520
there is a lot of gray areas in between the two.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
Some companies also allow

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,680
what is usually called tech lead manager,

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,640
but for the sake of this talk and for simplicity,

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,200
we are going to ignore this for now.

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,160
And so what is the latter?

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,880
The latter is usually the process that,

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,220
you know, is in companies to get promoted.

74
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,220
And so as I was mentioning earlier in my introduction,

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,500
like my time really at Twitter made me think

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,980
a little bit more about all this leadership

77
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,660
and like how, like sort of like a career for IC

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,480
is not that different for manager in the sense that,

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,740
so I was promoted to staff a couple of years ago.

80
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
My job really changed drastically.

81
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,740
However, I did not receive any proper or specific training

82
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,940
for that.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,460
And so what really, what happened to me,

84
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,060
it was, you know, I was trying to do my work

85
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,260
and then someone would say like,

86
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
oh, you should join this planning meeting.

87
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Or, you know, I was added to a bunch of other meetings

88
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,980
and at the same time, I was still being asked

89
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,580
to keep contributing, to keep being INC,

90
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,780
like to ship my own code, to ship my own analysis.

91
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,580
And at first I was very confused and annoyed

92
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,460
and I would like begrudgingly join all these meetings.

93
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,220
In fact, here's a picture of me in this meetings.

94
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,880
And again, like not really understanding

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,880
why I was being asked to do too many jobs at the same time.

96
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Over time, I realized that I was juggling multiple things

97
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,860
and maybe that is what the job is all about.

98
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,860
And so I was not only doing IC work for myself.

99
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,420
So like, again, pushing code in my case, doing analysis.

100
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,820
I was also mentoring junior people from my team, you know,

101
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,820
meaning helping them with the day-to-day sort of jobs

102
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,660
and should we do X or Y?

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,220
How do we interpret this analysis?

104
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,780
How do we frame this problem?

105
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,980
A lot of that.

106
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,400
And also people from other teams,

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,100
maybe more on the monthly basis or so.

108
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,820
But I was also involved in a lot of this sort of like

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,480
planning, team strategy, high-level meetings,

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,040
a lot of talking that I was not expecting at first.

111
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,340
And you know, oftentimes when the discussion of like,

112
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,740
should you be a manager?

113
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,460
Should you stay as an IC?

114
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,940
Should you be a team leader?

115
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,780
And so when these questions and ideas

116
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,940
and ideas and ideas and ideas come out,

117
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,940
I feel there is a lot of themes that keep coming back

118
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,820
and that I might disagree with.

119
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,780
So for example, I hear a lot, you know,

120
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,580
I want to remain on the C ladder

121
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,220
because I don't like meetings.

122
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,180
Or, you know, I don't like talking to people.

123
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,420
I don't like being interviewed.

124
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,380
So I think all of those are sort of like things

125
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,380
that I've seen and heard multiple times in conversation

126
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,140
when people were sort of deciding to be,

127
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,220
maybe to switch to management.

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,140
However, my friend Nick said that the best,

129
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
in the best way possible,

130
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,900
which is any simplicity advanced engineer

131
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,420
is indistinguishable from management.

132
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,220
It's a little bit of an exaggeration,

133
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,220
but is what the entire sort of like idea

134
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,020
behind this talk is.

135
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,300
So let's talk for a moment about ladders,

136
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,820
tech ladders, or how do you get promoted in a big company?

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,340
So here's an example of what, you know,

138
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,900
a data science ladder, for example,

139
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,420
could look like in your company.

140
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,380
So, you know, you have a couple of entry levels,

141
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,500
then you might get to like senior level.

142
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,580
And then there is a bunch of other things after senior.

143
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,900
Again, they might be called staff,

144
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
they might be called something else.

145
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,020
There might be, you know, here is a seven step ladder.

146
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,020
It might be a different number of levels in your company,

147
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,700
but it doesn't matter.

148
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,580
The point being, there is usually sort of like that level,

149
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,020
which in here, we identify between sort of like senior

150
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,980
and staff where the job really changes.

151
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,500
And that's where we call it geriatric,

152
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,580
as we defined earlier.

153
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,620
Sometimes, you know, some people might decide

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,980
that they want to actually do management.

155
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,620
And usually that happens not before someone reaches

156
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
sort of like the senior level of IC,

157
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,100
and they say, I would like to be a manager.

158
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,020
And the company says like, great, let me train you.

159
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,980
Let me give you some training for that.

160
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,100
And they would receive manager training and, you know,

161
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,540
be a manager.

162
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,540
On top of that, the more they go up their ladder,

163
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,620
they will have even more training.

164
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,660
Sometimes fancy school will do adult programs

165
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,500
for director plus or VP level.

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,860
And of course, this is absolutely not a complaint

167
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,900
about manager receiving training.

168
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,380
I do think, and I do hope people, you know,

169
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,220
companies will keep trained manager.

170
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,660
They are very important.

171
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,140
However, my question is what happens,

172
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,140
what do we get as ICs when we go up on our ladder?

173
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,100
We don't really get anything.

174
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,340
And so the point here in a maybe more visual way

175
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,620
is that the two ladders are not really parallel

176
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,620
as people tend to, as people like to think,

177
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,020
but they actually tend to collide.

178
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,580
And, you know, I know what you're asking now,

179
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,820
like, did I do this terrible slide myself?

180
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,860
Yes, thank you.

181
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,620
As you may know, graphic design is indeed my passion.

182
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,260
And so, you know, this is, it is something

183
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,260
that I have seen many people struggle in,

184
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,420
like at that level, when they not tend to be aware

185
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,300
of sort of like the leadership part.

186
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,180
Sometimes people tend to think that in order for them

187
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,820
to grow to the ladder, to be promoted to all the levels,

188
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,300
they just have to be sort of like more hardcore,

189
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,540
whatever that means.

190
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,460
However, this is not enough.

191
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,180
In fact, this is probably not the most important part.

192
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,100
So let's talk about skill sets.

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,740
What better way than talking about skill set

194
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,220
than Venn diagram?

195
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,940
In fact, you know, like Kamala, I do a lot of Venn diagrams

196
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,780
as well.

197
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,340
I said before, usually skill set are presented

198
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,380
very, in a very complimentary ways.

199
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,740
So, you know, you have manager skills

200
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,820
and then you have sort of like drag or IC skills

201
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,940
and, you know, they don't really touch.

202
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,540
Some example that, you know, we heard a lot is like,

203
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,900
oh, you're good at talking with people.

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,820
You should consider being a manager or maybe a PM.

205
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,300
However, I think, again, as I mentioned earlier,

206
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,700
I think this is a lie because after a certain threshold,

207
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,340
and again, that's where the dragic part comes in,

208
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,700
they really overlap a lot.

209
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,980
And so I do think that the real picture

210
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,780
is not to, it's not to non-overlapping Venn diagram,

211
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,300
but it's something like closer to this.

212
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,020
And of course there are some skills that are, you know,

213
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,260
IC only or manager only.

214
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,100
So for example, you know, as an IC,

215
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,460
you're indeed expected to, you know, publish your own code,

216
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,140
being opinionated about any kind of technical decision,

217
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,380
write technical design docs and whatnot.

218
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,740
As a manager, of course, you're, you know,

219
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,020
supposed to do a salary conversation with your reports.

220
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,620
You're supposed to honestly have a lot

221
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,060
of awkward conversation,

222
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,060
do a bunch of admin stuff and whatnot.

223
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,660
However, my point here is that the stuff that really matters

224
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,900
is not the stuff that it's on the border,

225
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,740
but it's stuff that's in the middle.

226
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,700
And that's what I see mostly tend to lack

227
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,820
because we lack training.

228
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,060
And so let's call this the make shit happen skills.

229
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,700
And so if we look at this, at this like area of overlap,

230
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,260
we see there is a lot of things that are classically

231
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,780
not associated with IC work, right?

232
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,980
So there is mentoring, for example, as I mentioned earlier,

233
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,180
like literally checking with more junior people

234
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,540
on a almost daily basis if needed,

235
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,700
if they're blocked, if they need help, a lot of meetings.

236
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,180
Some of this meeting might be about planning.

237
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,740
Some other meetings might be, you know, with other teams.

238
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,140
Indirect impact, so like, how do we make stuff happen

239
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,820
that I cannot do it myself because of lack of time?

240
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,220
And, you know, a big project honestly required a lot of people

241
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,100
and so a single person cannot and should not,

242
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,820
this is actually an anti-pattern, I think,

243
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,460
if a single person does everything by themselves.

244
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,860
And so what is it, you know,

245
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,740
what does it convincing people to do stuff mean?

246
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,700
Well, maybe it's, you know, you have an idea

247
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,660
and you want to get headcount for that.

248
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,780
In fact, our political amplification work

249
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,540
started exactly that way.

250
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,580
Like a simple idea, having a prototype

251
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,860
and then trying to get a larger team to work on that.

252
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,660
Maybe it's getting technical consensus

253
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,380
for a critical decision, or maybe it's helping,

254
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,580
you know, unblock someone on my team

255
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,100
to work with some other team.

256
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,780
Maybe there's an issue there

257
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,780
and they're not understanding each other.

258
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,020
Is there something we can do there?

259
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,660
Or maybe, you know, it was to convince other teams

260
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,660
that we should work together on a single issue.

261
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,500
And so honestly, these, you know, in my work,

262
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,620
this came out a lot because my team

263
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,860
did not own any of the models.

264
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,740
And so if you really wanted to have any kind of an impact

265
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,980
in the product, we had to convince other people

266
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,500
who owned the model themselves to,

267
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,940
to make the changes.

268
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,300
So that's where the indirect impact comes from.

269
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,660
And so this is sort of, again,

270
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,940
this is, this middle area is like the area that mostly,

271
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,900
talking to people is the part that is most invulnerable,

272
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,740
right?

273
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,340
And not doing code yourself,

274
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,460
but making sure that other people are enabled to do,

275
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
to do their work.

276
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,580
In fact, I would even argue that the technical work

277
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,660
is the easy part.

278
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,460
The people work is the hard part.

279
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,060
Sometimes teams have conflicting priorities.

280
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,900
How do you convince them that they should listen to you

281
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,740
instead of maybe their own priorities?

282
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,060
I do think that this is, you know,

283
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,460
like as I mentioned, like the people work

284
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,460
is really the hard part here.

285
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,260
And so what's the difference really?

286
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,820
You know, what do manager do maybe that we don't as I see?

287
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,620
You know, capitalism, like the military requires

288
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,900
a very strong hierarchical structure

289
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,460
where there can only be one person formally in charge.

290
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,260
And in companies, this is usually the manager.

291
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,660
And so usually they have internal responsibility

292
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,940
for the team.

293
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,620
And this goes both ways, right?

294
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,340
If something goes wrong,

295
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,220
they are the first one getting yelled.

296
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,860
And of course they will be able,

297
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,580
they will then try to figure out

298
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,060
what was wrong in the team.

299
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,380
At the same time, if you know, everything is great,

300
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,180
the manager will be the one sort of like represented

301
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,420
in the team for the phrases.

302
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,740
And of course, great manager will be able

303
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
to elevate their reports as well.

304
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,580
I mentioned that earlier, but I wanna say that again,

305
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,020
like part of a manager job is also to have a bunch

306
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,860
of awkward conversation.

307
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,060
Not everyone likes it.

308
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,100
And finally, you know, if you really want to sort of like

309
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,060
be a C-level person in a company,

310
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,060
eventually, if you eventually want to be a C-level person

311
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,980
in a company, most often all the path

312
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,900
involves the manager chain.

313
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,420
And so what I was thinking about this talk, I was like,

314
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,580
well, you know, what is that I've learned in my last,

315
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,300
you know, a few years in my career that really helped me?

316
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,300
What is like the sort of like a really important thing

317
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,140
I learned?

318
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,660
And I don't think it's anything related

319
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,020
to a specific technology, a specific library

320
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,300
or a specific whatever, but it's really like

321
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,300
the social skills that I learned in my career

322
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,100
and it's really like the social skills that I learned

323
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,780
just by doing this work.

324
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,540
And so, you know, the real transferable skills

325
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,860
are the friends or the social skills we made along the way.

326
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,540
And so to conclude and recap,

327
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,980
I wanna say that, you know,

328
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,660
manager usually get leadership training

329
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,060
when they start being managers.

330
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,060
However, I see don't even after they sort of like

331
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,700
pass a threshold that we call geriatric.

332
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,220
Their work is very similar to management.

333
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,940
So why don't we get the same training?

334
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I think as an industry, we should be more aware of that.

335
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,020
And, you know, especially because this is holding

336
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,980
many folks back because no one told people

337
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,540
that that is something that's really important.

338
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,780
And so that resonates with you.

339
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,340
And if you're interested,

340
00:18:38,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I've left some ways of keeping in touch.
